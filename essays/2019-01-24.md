why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, 
  - often be working in professional and busy environments even online
  - problem-solvers (sometimes problem may take some experiementing to do for anyone--don't want person you're asking to do it for you)
  - syntax and how data structures work is not abstract so easily documentable which means can easily find answer
  
how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, 
how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and 
the insights you gained as a result of this experience. 


## 

During the times I struggle with homework in my college coursework, I occasionally contemplate how convenient it would be to have my course's professor and/or teaching assistant sitting next to me at the ready to answer absolutely whatever questions I have or to spot the issues I don't notice I'm having in my work. Among the many possible repercussions this could result in is developing the habit and knack of asking "bad questions". There isn't fault in asking questions about something we truly don't know or can't grasp no matter how simple others may say those questions are. What would be the wrong step to take, however, when asking questions is, for one thing out of many, a lack of effort to actively seek the answer out ourselves beforehand instead of immediately firing a question at an online forum or a person because they're the closest and fastest resource available. 

## Software Engineers and 

Developing the skills     to ask "smart questions" is especially important for a software engineer. Questions  are often on very specific and concrete and clear-cut topics, such as syntax rules and how data structures work, which can be easily found through research, as opposed to philosphical and abstract and thought-provoking questions. In addition, probably two of the most typical label for software engineers is problem-solvers and critical thinkers, and 

## Stack Overflow is a pool of knowledge to be appreciated.

Stack Overflow is a website for asking and answering questions on programming.

Q: Why should I use pointers? C++

I am kinda new to c++ and I don't get why should I use pointers and references?

for example Idon't get how this works

int a = 8;
int *p1;
p1 = &a;
```

Pointers and references are two fundamental and common topics in C++ programming. Consequently, because they're fundamental and common, information would surely be available and readily accessible through resources such as online tutorials, blogs, and reference manuals. The author of this question also seems to be asking for a general, introductory explanation on the purpose and definition of pointers and references. The aforementioned resources would also definitely carry explanations that would fulfill that general and introductory nature in addition to specific examples similar to the one provided in the author's post. 

```
What don't you get? This is very basic and has been discussed in many places including your textbook/reference manual
```

Stack Overflow is also not only a place to ask and answer questions but also a place to view questions and answers. As stated

On the otherhand, if it was the case that the author wasn't able to grasp the explanations given after looking through, they should mention this also in their post. This would inform viewers that the author did indeed attempt to search for and understand the question beforehand and thus make viewers more inclined to answer the author's question. In addition, though it may seem relatively negligible since it doesn't necessarily affect the content of the question, correct grammar helps one's post exude a courteous and well-thought out question image     . Incorrect grammar on the otherhand would reflect the possible hastiness and disregard one typed out their post with
