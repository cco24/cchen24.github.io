why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, 
  - often be working in professional and busy environments even online
  - problem-solvers (sometimes problem may take some experiementing to do for anyone--don't want person you're asking to do it for you)
  - syntax and how data structures work is not abstract so easily documentable which means can easily find answer
  
how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, 
how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and 
the insights you gained as a result of this experience. 


Asking "bad questions" 
The value and quality of one's question depends on 
However, a work environment 

During the times I struggle with homework in my college coursework, I occasionally contemplate how convenient it would be to have my professor and/or TA sitting next to me at the ready to answer absolutely whatever questions I have or to spot the issues I don't notice I'm having in my work. Among the many possible repercussions this would result in, developing the habit and knack of asking "bad questions" is a huge one    . There's no fault in asking questions about something we truly don't know or can't grasp no matter how simple others might say those questions are. What would be wrong, however, when asking questions is, for one thing out of many, a lack of effort to actively seek the answer out ourselves beforehand instead of immediately firing a question at a forum or person because they're the closest and fastest resource available. Developing the skills     to ask "smart questions" is especially important for a software engineer. Questions in this field are very often about 



Often, many of the questions we ask are simple, but yet it's understandable if we don't understand (after all, we

Q: Why should I use pointers? C++

I am kinda new to c++ and I don't get why should I use pointers and references?

for example Idon't get how this works

int a = 8;
int *p1;
p1 = &a;
```
This is a fair question in my opinion--I've wondered the same when I first started learning C and C++ coming from a Java background, in which pointers weren't really used. 

```
What don't you get? This is very basic and has been discussed in many places including your textbook/reference manual
```
If the author of the question didn't understand even after taking the time to read and re-read the section in their textbook/reference manual on pointers and is thus asking on Stack Overflow, making it clear the specific aspect on what they didn't understand. 

```
[name of author of previous comment] is correct, this has been discussed many times. I'd suggest a quick google search and reading docs like (link) this

Or, if they didn't understand, according to the author of this comment,
