## The rare occasion where it's okay to have someone do the work for you
I didn't see being required to follow coding standards as much of a chore when my Software Engineering course transitioned from programming in JSFiddle to programming in IntelliJ IDEA. My previous Computer Science courses up until this one always started off with coding in an IDE with coding standards set up, and I got into the habit of writing "standardly neat" code. As a result, when I started using JSFiddle for this course, I felt uncomfortable with not having an official set of coding standards to follow yet because, personally, I'm picky with certain format components like spacing when it comes to writing my own code. But at the same time, I dislike debating between questions such as, "Should I actually put a space after the function declaration before the curly brace? Am I actually allowed to write the function body in one line? Can I put extra newlines in between each function?" Following coding standards may actually be less work than many may think--the rules for formatting one's code are already laid out, and unlike with theoretical concepts of Computer Science, all that programmers have to is blindly follow them. 

## Don't let your time and effort go to waste 
Imagine being on a time crunch with a coding assignment that's due the next day. Not because you've just started an hour ago, but because you started and wrote most of the code 4 days ago, and you need to look over your entire code to try and remember what and why you did. Sifting through code that's unecessarily messy would only throw one into more of a panic during that time crunch. Even if one were to be able to read and finish said code, collaborators, professors, bosses, and any other viewers would need to be able to also, and it would be even more difficult for them to read code that's written by someone else in "their own coding standards". One may find themselves being judged for their character and capabilities based on the look of their own code, regardless of the correctness of their program. The appearance of code is often the first thing people process when looking at it, and it also reflects the programmer's regard for their own work and regard for the people who will be looking at the code, regardless of how efficiently written it is or how correct it is. The tediousness and pain that accompanies fulfilling the extra and seemingly mundane task of following coding standards will most likely not be permanent. It's payoff will most likely be better than being caught off-guard one day when one's code can't be read by themselves or someone else.
