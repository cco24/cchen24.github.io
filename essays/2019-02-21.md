## UI Frameworks
One might think UI frameworks resemble templates too much and that this will hinder creativity and preferences as a result, but the libraries of those frameworks are extensive in not only elements themselves, but in their variations. Spending time on the pixelated spacing and layout of elements probably isn't part of most people's desired creative process on the otherhand, and so, in addition to their extensive libraries, UI frameworks eases the workload while staying clear of hindering creativity by handling those things. 

## It's the "new and latest" tool.
When I began my first Software Engineering course, I realized just how many tools a developer needs to know how to use, and it was pretty daunting. Up until that moment, I've learned mainly how to code and the theoretical aspects of Computer Science. I knew how to implement arrays in both Java and C. I knew the general process of algorithm runtime analysis. What I didn't know was how to use GitHub and Chrome Developer Tools. It is indeed pretty daunting to me, but I eventually saw how great it is to learn tools like these with which to code. Keeping up-to-date with the new and latest software and tools is an integral part to the field of Software Engineering, so why shouldn't UI frameworks be a part of those new and latest tools to learn for developers? It's understandable if a developer doesn't want to learn it because they've already tried exploring it and found that they don't like it, but it probably isn't if a developer says that they have all the tools they need .

## But they might not know everything we want.
I haven't used any UI frameworks extensively enough to get a good measure, but one of the questions on my mind while I was first learning what a UI framework was how limited can one be. In Semantic UI, I might not like, let's say, the width of the margins preset by `ui menu`. I might want a different font for `ui label` or an even larger size than the one provided in `ui huge header`. I'm pretty sure there's ways in Semantic UI to accomodate the aforementioned preferences, but my point is that what if there might be certain variations and/or states one might desire for an element that isn't available in a framework? Especially when the unavailable thing desired is an actual element, such as a carousel or slideshow presentation of images, which I was searching for in Semantic UI in my attempt to reimplement Blue Bunny Ice Cream's homepage.
