Before starting this essay, read through the “Foundations” experiences in the Ethics module, and the two “Code of Ethics” readings.

Now review through the Case Studies (Haraassment, Privacy, Autonomous Cars, Facebook, etc), and pick one of these studies to focus on for your technical essay.

Write an interesting, informative technical essay about ethics in software engineering. You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering. Then, describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?






It's probably safe to say that society won't ever escape the clutches of technology, and the impacts of technology can be helpful or destructive. A software engineer thus holds destructive power in their hands, and it's important that he/she knows that. When he/she does, society just has to hope that he/she will wield that power responsibly. To me, being an ethical software engineer at the very least means creating software that doesn't harm society or the environment. 

In order to uphold that goal, an ethical software engineer must have and develop the ability to think for oneself. Software engineers technically don't program directly for the consumers but for their higher-ups, and yet, at the end of the day, the final product will go to the consumer. Therefore,
