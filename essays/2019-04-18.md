It's probably safe to say that society won't ever escape the clutches of technology, and the impacts of technology can be helpful or destructive. A software engineer thus holds destructive power in their hands, and it's important that he/she knows that. When he/she does, society just has to hope that he/she will wield that power responsibly. To me, being an ethical software engineer at the very least means creating software that doesn't harm society or the environment. In order to uphold that goal, an ethical software engineer must have and develop the ability to think for oneself; qualities of justice, honesty, and accountability; and willingness to participate in society. 

["The code that I'm still ashamed of"](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e) is one example of how blindly following instructions, even ones given from the boss, can have devastating results. In the case of the former boss of the author of the article, he/she either 1) wasn't aware also or 2) didn't not care for whatever impacts would happen so long as the financial agenda was fulfilled. Work is the livelihood of humans, and the boss is the boss. That's why it would take a good amount of tenacity to be able to walk away from the work that infringes on one's sense of moral responsibility. Moreover, one would need a strong sense of moral responsibility in the first place and to be able to stop and "question the man" first. 

"The code that I'm still ashamed of" also shows how important it is to be involved in society to some degree because software engineers basically make stuff for said society. We can't always rely on intermediate people like bosses to know what's good for society, and neither can we rely on society themselves, including ourselves, sometimes to know what's best for itself unfortunately. Software companies should thus restructure the work environment where the software engineers and programmers have more direct interaction with the clients, and user testing should also be proritized further, for example. In addition, societal involvement needs to be promoted not only within the work environment, but also in the form of interpersonal skills and empathy amongst the software engineers.
