This program is a basic, non-graphical implementation of tic-tac-toe based on four exercises found on Michele Pratusevich's [practicepython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/about/). 

In ["Exercise 24 Draw a Game Board"](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/27/24-draw-a-game-board.html), a module to print the arbitrarily sized game board as a single ```string```, a module to check throughout the game if and which player won, a module to modify the ```string``` board with the players' moves during the actual game, and putting all those modules together to create the game. In addition to the

I was exposed to the intricacies of how logic is applied in programming and the multitude of methods for storing and accessing data, but those courses were difficult for me, and I wasn't able to grasp all that I was taught.
