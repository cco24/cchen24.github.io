After my first year of Java programming courses in college, I felt like I learned a lot but, at the same time, not a lot. I was exposed to the intricacies of how logic is applied in programming and the multitude of methods for storing and accessing data, but those courses were difficult for me, and I wasn't able to grasp all that I was taught. Instead of being whole and organized, I felt like my understanding of what I learned in those courses was muddled and contained holes of missing information I failed to retain. Thus, over that following summer, I decided to brush up on my programming skills by revisiting general progamming fundamentals. 



But those courses were difficult for me and I felt that my understanding of 





This program is a basic, non-graphical implementation of tic-tac-toe based on four exercises found on practicepython.org. The author of the website and exercises is Michele Pratusevich. The creation process is split up into those four exercises: a module to print the arbitrarily sized game board as a single ```string```, a module to check throughout the game if and which player won, a module to modify the ```string``` board with the players' moves during the actual game, and putting all those modules together to create the game. In addition to the
