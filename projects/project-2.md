Learning how to navigate through a new operating system and discovering one's favorite aspects about it can be an interesting and exciting experience. However, the lack of the cross-platform characteristic in the applications and services one used on a previous operating system might dim the thrill of that experience and upset routine. My life revolves around a laptop but not so much a phone, and so, I was pretty appreciative for iMessages since it allowed me to send and receive text messages on my MacBook to and from my iPhone, a feature I missed a lot when I started using a Windows laptop while still owning said iPhone. As a result, I was    when I happened upon Chapter 13 of Al St ["Automating the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) where it teaches how to send SMS messages with Twilio.
