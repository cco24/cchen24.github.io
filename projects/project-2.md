Learning how to navigate through a new operating system and discovering one's favorite aspects about it can be an interesting and exciting experience. However, the lack of the cross-platform characteristic in the applications and services one used on a previous operating system might dim the thrill of that experience and upset routine. My life revolves around a laptop but not so much a phone, and so, I was appreciative for iMessages since it allowed me to send and receive text messages on my MacBook to and from my iPhone, a feature I missed a lot when I started using a Windows laptop while still owning said iPhone. I was, thus, ecstatic when I saw the title of Chapter 16, "Sending Email and Text Messages", from Al Sweigart's [*Automating the Boring Stuff with Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) where it teaches how to send SMS with Twilio. 

After reading it, though, I realized this wasn't going to be my ideal "replacement" method for texting via laptop, but I was still interested in seeing the process and result of creating this Python program. Twilio is a service that provides APIs for video, messaging, and voice communication for web and mobile applications. The steps I needed to take before writing the actual code was to sign up for an account and register for a Twilio phone number from which I sent SMS to my personal phome number.
