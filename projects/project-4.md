hangryFIX was developed by James Hutchison, Katrina Johnson Turner, and I as our final project for our ICS 314 course. This web application was designed for reviewing, viewing, and adding information on food items, which are searchable by cuisine on the landing page. I focused mainly on designing the presentation of each individual food item and the information and user reviews associated with it along with implementing the user account page. My group decided that the information to be presented with each food item was its restaurant name, hours, and location; price range; reviews; tags describing the food item (such as the type of cuisine); average rating based on all of the item's reviews; and an image of the item. Regarding the user account page, I laid out the page where users could view the nine of the most recently added foods, all their reviews they wrote, and the food items associated with their favorite food tags. The experiences I took out of this project included ones typical to any programmer such as how to fix bugs, but I think the most important experience of all for me revolves around working on software in a group and systematically breaking down the responsibilities amongst us. It was challenging trying to get around the conflicts that occurred with that breakdown of responsibilities because there would be times when one would need a task that another is in charge of to be done in order to finish their own. It was also rewarding, however, knowing that there are other people besides myself whom I could share the responsibilities of the project with and with whom I could consult with.
